## About CAADRIA

The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) promotes teaching and research in CAAD in Asia, and has members on six continents.

It organizes an annual conference, the first of which was held in 1996 in Hong Kong. Since then, 20 conferences have been held in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. The conferences provide an opportunity for teachers, students, researchers, and practitioners to meet each other and learn about the latest research in the field. The proceedings of the conferences are available both on line and in research libraries around the world.

CAADRIA was founded in 1996 with the following objectives:

* To facilitate the dissemination of information about CAAD among Asian schools of architecture, planning, engineering, and building sciences.
* To encourage the exchange of staff, students, experience, courseware, and software among schools.
* To identify research and develop needs in CAAD education and to initiate collaboration to satisfy them.
* To promote research and teaching in CAAD that enhances creativity rather than production.

CAADRIA is one of the four founding organizations of the International Journal of Architectural Computing (IJAC), and supervises one issue each year. IJAC is published by Multi-Science in both paper and electronic versions.

## Charters

### Objectives
1. facilitate the dissemination of information about CAAD amongst the Asian Schools of Architecture, Planning, Engineering, and Building Sciences.
1. to encourage the exchange of software, courseware, experiences and staff/students amongst schools
1. to identify research and development needs specific to CAAD education and initiate collaboration to satisfy them.

### Governance
The General Membership governs CAADRIA through elected representatives or directly by representation at meetings or through postal ballots. For most activities, this means that CAADRIA is governed by an elected Administrative Council elected by the membership. Responsibility for organisation, administration and guidance of the association shall be delegated to this Council by virtue of the election of the officers. Membership of the council shall be restricted to members working in countries within the Asia Pacific region; terms of office are for two years. No member of this council may be elected for more than two consecutive terms (four years).

There is an annual general meeting (normally convened during the annual conference) at which the business of the association is agreed by the membership. This forum shall be considered the highest level of authority and shall be the only one with the power to amend this charter.

Where important business must be conducted and a meeting is not feasible, postal ballots will be used.

### Activities
The association organises an annual conference within the Asia Pacific region. A newsletter will be published over electronic mail at irregular intervals to inform the membership of activities of interest.

### Membership
Membership is open to individuals, not institutions. Membership is extended to all who teach or conduct research in computer aided architectural design.

Membership dues will be levied to cover the administrative costs of the association which cannot be met by other means.

### Administration
The Association shall be run by a Secretariat located in an institution at which members are located. The Secretariat shall be composed of volunteer staff only, with a limited budget being made available through membership dues and supervised by the Administrative Council. The location of the Secretariat may be reviewed at each Annual General Meeting.

### Adoption of Charter
This Charter was adopted by at the first CAADRIA meeting, April 26, 1996 in Hong Kong.
